Neutrino is a fast and lightweight web browser, built with Qt for cross-platform compatibility and powered by Chromium's
Blink Engine for better performance and compatibility with the latest Web technologies. Neutrino preloads the page you're
the most likely to visit next, thus reducing loading times and speeding up browsing. Features also include multi-tab
navigation.
