# Neutrino

Neutrino is a fast and lightweight web browser, built with Qt for cross-platform compatibility and powered by Chromium's
Blink Engine for better performance and compatibility with the latest Web technologies. Neutrino analyses your browsing history and preloads the page you're the most likely to visit next, thus reducing loading times and speeding up web navigation.
